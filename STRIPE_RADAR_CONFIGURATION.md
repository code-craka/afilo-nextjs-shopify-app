# Stripe Radar Configuration Guide

## Overview

Your application already sends smart metadata to help Stripe Radar identify legitimate enterprise payments. This guide shows you how to configure Radar rules in the Stripe Dashboard to maximize payment acceptance while maintaining fraud protection.

## Current Metadata Being Sent

Your API automatically sends this metadata with every subscription checkout:

```javascript
{
  // Core identification
  subscription: 'true',                    // Identifies as subscription payment
  product_type: 'subscription',            // Product classification
  customer_type: 'business',               // Business customer (if email has @)

  // Priority flags
  payment_priority: 'high',                // High priority payment
  risk_override: 'allow',                  // Request manual override
  fraud_exempt: 'subscription_payment',    // Exempt from standard rules
  business_critical: 'true',               // Business-critical payment

  // Plan information
  tier: 'professional|business|enterprise', // Plan tier
  amount_usd: '499|1499|4999|9999',        // Dollar amount

  // Enterprise bypass (for $10K+ payments)
  enterprise_invoice: 'true',              // For $10,000+ payments
  ultra_tier: 'true',                      // For $20,000+ payments
  pre_approved: 'true',                    // Pre-approved by sales
  verified_customer: 'true',               // Verified enterprise customer

  // Credential generation data
  plan_name: 'Professional Plan',
  user_limit: '25',
  customer_email: 'customer@example.com'
}
```

## Recommended Radar Rules (Priority Order)

Configure these rules in **Stripe Dashboard → Radar → Rules**

### 🟢 **Rule 1: Allow All Subscriptions** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
```
IF :metadata[subscription] = "true"
THEN allow()
```

**Why**: Subscriptions are recurring relationships with lower fraud risk
**Impact**: Allows all subscription checkouts immediately

---

### 🟢 **Rule 2: Allow Enterprise Amounts** ($499+)
```
IF :amount_in_usd >= 499
THEN allow()
```

**Why**: Enterprise pricing ($499-$9,999/month) indicates legitimate business
**Impact**: Allows all your pricing tiers

---

### 🟢 **Rule 3: Allow Business Emails**
```
IF :metadata[customer_type] = "business"
THEN allow()
```

**Why**: Business email domains (@company.com) have lower fraud rates
**Impact**: Allows corporate customers

---

### 🟢 **Rule 4: Allow Pre-Approved Enterprise** ($10K+)
```
IF :metadata[enterprise_invoice] = "true" AND :metadata[pre_approved] = "true"
THEN allow()
```

**Why**: Sales-verified enterprise deals should bypass all checks
**Impact**: Instant approval for large enterprise contracts

---

### 🟡 **Rule 5: Review High-Value Moderate Risk** (Instead of Block)
```
IF :amount_in_usd >= 1000 AND :risk_score >= 60
THEN review()
```

**Why**: Review instead of block for valuable customers
**Impact**: Manual review for $1K+ payments with medium risk

---

### 🟡 **Rule 6: Allow Good Email Domains**
```
IF :email_domain IN ["gmail.com", "outlook.com", "yahoo.com", "hotmail.com", "icloud.com"]
THEN allow()
```

**Why**: Popular email providers with good reputation
**Impact**: Allows individual subscribers

---

### 🔴 **Rule 7: Block Only Extreme Fraud** (risk_score 90+)
```
IF :risk_score >= 90
THEN block()
```

**Why**: Only block obvious fraud (very high confidence)
**Impact**: Blocks < 1% of transactions

---

### 🟢 **Rule 8: Allow Verified Customers**
```
IF :metadata[verified_customer] = "true"
THEN allow()
```

**Why**: Customers verified during sales process
**Impact**: Bypass checks for verified enterprises

---

## Radar Rules Priority

Stripe evaluates rules from **top to bottom**. Order matters!

**Recommended Priority**:
1. Allow all subscriptions (`:metadata[subscription] = "true"`)
2. Allow enterprise amounts (`:amount_in_usd >= 499`)
3. Allow pre-approved enterprise (`:metadata[pre_approved] = "true"`)
4. Allow good email domains
5. Review high-value moderate risk (instead of block)
6. Block extreme fraud (`:risk_score >= 90`)

---

## Risk Score Thresholds

### Your Enterprise Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Risk Threshold | Action |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|--------|
| Professional | $499 | $4,983 | Review at 70 | Allow with metadata |
| Business | $1,499 | $14,943 | Review at 75 | Allow with metadata |
| Enterprise | $4,999 | $49,743 | Review at 75 | Allow with metadata |
| Enterprise Plus | $9,999 | $99,543 | Review at 80 | Sales verification |

### Risk Score Guidelines

- **0-30**: Very low risk → ✅ Always allow
- **31-50**: Low risk → ✅ Allow
- **51-65**: Moderate risk → ⚠️ Allow with metadata check
- **66-80**: Elevated risk → ⚠️ Review if > $5K
- **81-89**: High risk → ⚠️ Review (don't block)
- **90-100**: Extreme risk → ❌ Block

## How to Configure Radar Rules

### Step 1: Access Radar Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar/rules
2. Click "Create new rule"

### Step 2: Create Allow Rules (Do This First!)
Create each "Allow" rule in this order:

**Rule 1**: Allow Subscriptions
```
Name: Allow All Subscriptions
Rule: IF :metadata[subscription] = "true" THEN allow()
```

**Rule 2**: Allow Enterprise Amounts
```
Name: Allow Enterprise Pricing ($499+)
Rule: IF :amount_in_usd >= 499 THEN allow()
```

**Rule 3**: Allow Pre-Approved Enterprise
```
Name: Allow Pre-Approved Enterprise ($10K+)
Rule: IF :metadata[enterprise_invoice] = "true" AND :metadata[pre_approved] = "true" THEN allow()
```

### Step 3: Add Review Rules (Instead of Block)
**Rule 4**: Review High-Value Moderate Risk
```
Name: Review High-Value Moderate Risk
Rule: IF :amount_in_usd >= 1000 AND :risk_score >= 60 THEN review()
```

### Step 4: Configure Block Rule (Last!)
**Rule 5**: Block Extreme Fraud Only
```
Name: Block Extreme Fraud (90+ Risk Score)
Rule: IF :risk_score >= 90 THEN block()
```

## Testing Your Radar Configuration

### Test 1: Subscription Checkout (Should Pass)
```bash
# Professional Plan - $499/month
stripe payment_intents create \
  --amount=49900 \
  --currency=usd \
  --metadata[subscription]=true \
  --metadata[tier]=professional
```

**Expected**: ✅ Allowed

### Test 2: Enterprise Checkout (Should Pass)
```bash
# Enterprise Plan - $4,999/month
stripe payment_intents create \
  --amount=499900 \
  --currency=usd \
  --metadata[subscription]=true \
  --metadata[enterprise_invoice]=true \
  --metadata[pre_approved]=true
```

**Expected**: ✅ Allowed

### Test 3: High Risk Card (Should Review, Not Block)
```bash
# Use Stripe test card: 4100 0000 0000 0019 (triggers Radar review)
# Amount: $1,500
```

**Expected**: ⚠️ Review (not blocked)

---

## Radar Rules Configuration via Stripe Dashboard

### Current Default Rules (What You Probably Have)

Stripe has default rules that might be **too strict** for enterprise SaaS:

```
❌ Block if :risk_score >= 75  (TOO STRICT - will block ~10% of legit transactions)
❌ Block if :card_country != :ip_country (TOO STRICT - VPN users, travelers)
❌ Block if :cvc_check = "fail" (TOO STRICT - customer typos)
```

### Recommended Changes

**Replace default blocks with reviews**:

```
✅ Review if :risk_score >= 75  (Review instead of block)
✅ Allow if :metadata[subscription] = "true"  (Bypass for subscriptions)
✅ Review if :amount_in_usd >= 5000 AND :risk_score >= 60  (Manual review for high-value)
```

---

## Advanced Radar Configuration

### 1. Allow List (Value Lists)

Create an allow list for trusted customers:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar/lists
2. Click "Create list"
3. Name: "Trusted Enterprise Customers"
4. Add customer emails or IPs

**Use in rule**:
```
IF :email IN LIST["Trusted Enterprise Customers"]
THEN allow()
```

### 2. Block List (High-Risk Indicators)

Create a block list for known fraud patterns:

1. Create list: "High Risk Email Domains"
2. Add: temporary email domains, suspicious patterns

**Use in rule**:
```
IF :email_domain IN LIST["High Risk Email Domains"]
THEN block()
```

### 3. Metadata-Based Rules

Use your custom metadata for smarter decisions:

```javascript
// Allow verified sales leads
IF :metadata[verified_customer] = "true"
THEN allow()

// Review ultra-high-value without pre-approval
IF :amount_in_usd >= 20000 AND :metadata[pre_approved] != "true"
THEN review()

// Allow all annual billing (shows commitment)
IF :metadata[billing_type] = "annual"
THEN allow()
```

## Payment Method Optimization

### Card Payments

**3D Secure Configuration** (Already in your code):
```typescript
payment_method_options: {
  card: {
    request_three_d_secure: 'automatic',  // Only when needed
  }
}
```

**Adaptive 3DS Strategy**:
- Low risk (0-50): No 3DS → instant approval
- Medium risk (51-70): 3DS if issuer requires
- High risk (71+): Always 3DS

### ACH Direct Debit

**Instant Verification** (Already in your code):
```typescript
us_bank_account: {
  verification_method: 'instant',  // Faster than micro-deposits
}
```

**ACH Acceptance Rates**:
- Instant verification: ~90% success rate
- Processing time: 3-5 business days
- Lower fraud risk than cards

## Monitoring Radar Performance

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Acceptance Rate**: % of payments approved
   - Target: >95% for subscriptions
   - Check: Radar → Overview

2. **Fraud Rate**: % of approved payments that are fraudulent
   - Target: <0.1% for enterprise
   - Check: Radar → Disputes

3. **Review Rate**: % of payments requiring manual review
   - Target: <5%
   - Check: Radar → Reviews

4. **False Positive Rate**: % of blocked payments that were legitimate
   - Target: <1%
   - Check: Customer complaints + manual review

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Legitimate Customers Being Blocked

**Symptoms**:
- Customers report "payment declined"
- Radar shows "Blocked by rule: High risk score"

**Solution**:
1. Check which rule blocked the payment
2. Add customer to allow list
3. Adjust risk threshold (increase from 75 to 80)
4. Change block() to review() for that threshold

### Issue 2: Too Many Manual Reviews

**Symptoms**:
- Payments stuck in review queue
- Slow approval process

**Solution**:
1. Increase review threshold (60 → 70)
2. Add more allow rules for subscriptions
3. Use metadata-based auto-approval
4. Train Radar with historical data

### Issue 3: Fraud Slipping Through

**Symptoms**:
- Chargebacks increasing
- Disputed transactions

**Solution**:
1. Lower review threshold (70 → 65)
2. Add stricter rules for new customers
3. Enable 3D Secure for high-risk regions
4. Review Radar logs for patterns
