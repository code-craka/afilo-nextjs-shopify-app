@shopify-api Help me add a new product variant field
```

### 2. Multiple agents for complex tasks
```bash
@shopify-api Fetch products efficiently
@nextjs-performance Cache the results properly
```

### 3. Context-aware requests
Agents will:
- ‚úÖ Read only relevant files (not entire codebase)
- ‚úÖ Leverage existing caching systems
- ‚úÖ Reference production Price IDs and environment variables
- ‚úÖ Follow TypeScript strict mode and security best practices

## Benefits of Using Agents

### üöÄ Token Efficiency
- Agents read only 5-10 files (vs 50+ in full context)
- Focused expertise = faster responses
- Leverage cached knowledge from CLAUDE.md

### üéØ Specialized Knowledge
- Each agent is an expert in their domain
- Pre-configured with project-specific details
- Know exactly which files to check

### üîÑ Caching Optimization
- Agents understand our caching layers:
  - TanStack Query (client-side)
  - Cache Manager (server-side)
  - Upstash Redis (rate limiting)
- Will suggest proper cache strategies

### üõ°Ô∏è Security First
- Security agent for all auth/payment changes
- Automatic IDOR and rate limit checks
- Compliance-aware recommendations

## Agent Selection Guide

| Task | Agent(s) |
|------|----------|
| Product catalog changes | `@shopify-api` |
| Subscription plan updates | `@stripe-payments` |
| User authentication flow | `@clerk-auth` |
| Slow page load | `@nextjs-performance` |
| Security vulnerability | `@security-audit` |
| UI component creation | `@ui-components` |
| New feature (complex) | Multiple agents sequentially |

---

## Example Workflows

### Add New Subscription Plan
```bash
# Step 1: Create Stripe product
@stripe-payments Create new "Pro Plus" plan at $2,999/month

# Step 2: Update UI
@ui-components Add pricing card for Pro Plus plan

# Step 3: Test security
@security-audit Verify webhook handling for new plan
```

### Optimize Product Loading
```bash
# Step 1: Analyze performance
@nextjs-performance Why is ProductGrid slow?

# Step 2: Implement caching
@shopify-api Add proper TanStack Query configuration

# Step 3: Verify results
@nextjs-performance Measure LCP improvement
```

### Fix Security Issue
```bash
# Step 1: Identify vulnerability
@security-audit Review /api/cart endpoint for IDOR

# Step 2: Implement fix
@security-audit Add ownership validation

# Step 3: Test
@security-audit Run automated security tests
```

## Tips for Maximum Efficiency

1. **Be Specific**: "Add ACH payment method" vs "Help with payments"
2. **Chain Agents**: Use multiple agents for complex tasks
3. **Reference Existing Code**: Agents know our architecture
4. **Trust the Cache**: Agents leverage our 3-layer caching
5. **Security First**: Always involve `@security-audit` for auth/payments

---

## Agent Maintenance

Agents are automatically updated when:
- New features are added (Stripe plans, Shopify fields, etc.)
- Architecture changes (new caching layer, database schema)
- Security policies update (rate limits, compliance standards)
