## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Testing Locally

Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev --turbopack
```

Visit the test page:
```
http://localhost:3000/test-stripe-payment
```

Use test cards from the guide to test different scenarios.

### 2. Integrating into Your App

Import the payment form component:
```tsx
import StripePaymentForm from '@/components/stripe/StripePaymentForm';

export default function CheckoutPage() {
  return (
    <StripePaymentForm
      amount={49900}  // $499.00 in cents
      productName="Professional Plan"
      productId="prod_123"
      customerEmail="customer@example.com"
      onSuccess={(paymentIntentId) => {
        console.log('Payment succeeded:', paymentIntentId);
        // Redirect to success page or show confirmation
      }}
      onError={(error) => {
        console.error('Payment failed:', error);
        // Show error message to user
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### 3. Handling Webhooks

The webhook handler is already complete and will:
1. Verify webhook signature
2. Process payment events
3. Log all events
4. Return success/error responses

**CRITICAL:** Only fulfill orders after `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook!

For ACH payments:
- `payment_intent.processing`: Update status to "Processing" (don't fulfill yet)
- `payment_intent.succeeded`: **NOW fulfill the order** (3-5 days later)

### 4. Order Fulfillment Integration

Add your order fulfillment logic in the webhook handlers:

**File:** `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`

**Function:** `handlePaymentSuccess()`

```typescript
async function handlePaymentSuccess(paymentIntent: Stripe.PaymentIntent) {
  // TODO: Add your order fulfillment logic here
  // 1. Update order status in database
  // 2. Grant product access
  // 3. Send confirmation email
  // 4. Log analytics event
}
```

## 📊 Payment Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Card Payment (90% of US transactions)

```
1. Customer enters card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
2. Stripe validates card
3. Risk score: 45 (low risk)
4. 3DS: NOT triggered (frictionless)
5. Payment processes in 2 seconds
6. Webhook: payment_intent.succeeded
7. ✅ Order fulfilled immediately
```

**Customer experience:** Instant checkout, no extra steps

### Scenario 2: High-Risk Card (Adaptive 3DS)

```
1. Customer enters card from high-risk country
2. Stripe validates card
3. Risk score: 78 (high risk) + Amount: $999 (high value)
4. 3DS: TRIGGERED automatically
5. Customer completes bank verification (face ID / SMS)
6. Payment processes after 3DS
7. Webhook: payment_intent.succeeded
8. ✅ Order fulfilled
```

**Customer experience:** Extra security step, but necessary for fraud prevention

### Scenario 3: ACH Bank Payment

```
1. Customer enters bank account
2. Stripe validates routing/account numbers
3. Webhook: payment_intent.processing
4. ⏳ Order status: "Processing"
5. ⏳ Wait 3-5 business days
6. ACH payment clears
7. Webhook: payment_intent.succeeded
8. ✅ Order fulfilled
```

**Customer experience:** Lower fees, but longer wait time

## 💰 Transaction Fees

### Card Payments
- **Stripe fee:** 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **Example:** $499 charge = $14.77 fee → You receive $484.23

### ACH Payments
- **Stripe fee:** 0.8% (capped at $5.00)
- **Example:** $499 charge = $3.99 fee → You receive $495.01
- **Savings:** $10.78 per transaction vs card

### High-Value Transactions
- **$2,499 card:** $72.77 fee
- **$2,499 ACH:** $5.00 fee (capped)
- **Savings:** $67.77 per transaction

**Recommendation:** Encourage ACH for high-value enterprise sales
