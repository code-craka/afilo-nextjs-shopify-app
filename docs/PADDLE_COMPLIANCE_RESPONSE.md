# Paddle Business Verification - Compliance Response

**Date**: January 30, 2025
**Domain**: app.afilo.io
**Business**: TechSci, Inc. (Afilo Enterprise Platform)

## Executive Summary

All three Paddle verification requirements have been addressed with comprehensive policy updates. Our refund policy now fully complies with Paddle's requirements for a transparent, unconditional 30-day money-back guarantee.

---

## Issue 1: Refund Policy Qualifiers/Exceptions ✅ RESOLVED

### **Paddle's Concern**
> "Your refund policy contains qualifiers or exceptions, which Paddle does not support."

### **What We Fixed**
**Removed all conditional qualifiers from the 30-day guarantee:**

**BEFORE (Problematic):**
- "First-time customers only (one refund per organization)"
- "Account must not have violated Terms of Service"
- "Good faith usage (no abuse or fraudulent intent)"
- Multiple eligibility requirements creating barriers

**AFTER (Paddle-Compliant):**
> "If you are not satisfied with Afilo for any reason within the first 30 days of your initial paid subscription, you may request a full refund—**no questions asked**."

### **Key Changes**
1. ✅ Removed "first-time customers only" restriction
2. ✅ Removed "good faith usage" qualifier
3. ✅ Removed Terms of Service violation restriction
4. ✅ Simplified refund request process (no lengthy justifications required)
5. ✅ Deleted entire "Non-Refundable Scenarios" section (8 problematic restrictions)

### **What We Kept (Paddle-Allowed)**
- 30-day time limit on initial purchase (industry standard)
- No refunds for renewals after 30 days (compliant with subscription model)
- No pro-rata refunds for mid-cycle cancellations (standard practice)

---

## Issue 2: "All Sales Are Final" Language ✅ RESOLVED

### **Paddle's Concern**
> "Your refund policy states that all sales are final, which Paddle does not support."

### **What We Fixed**
**Completely removed restrictive "all sales are final" language:**

**BEFORE (Problematic - Line 29):**
> "Due to the nature of digital services, **all sales are final once access is granted**, subject to the exceptions outlined in this policy."

**AFTER (Paddle-Compliant - Lines 28-30):**
> "Our services are delivered entirely digitally, with instant access upon payment. All subscriptions include our **30-day money-back guarantee** as outlined below."

### **Positive Framing**
Instead of stating what customers **cannot** do, we now emphasize what they **can** do:
- "30-day money-back guarantee included"
- "No questions asked refund policy"
- "Full refund if not satisfied for any reason"

---

## Issue 3: Human-Driven Services Clarification ✅ RESOLVED

### **Paddle's Concern**
> "Confirm whether human-driven services are involved in your offering."

### **Our Clear Answer: NO - Pure SaaS Only**

We added an **explicit new section** (Section 3) clarifying our service model:

**Section 3: Service Type: Digital SaaS Only**

**What Afilo is:**
- ✅ Pure digital software-as-a-service (SaaS)
- ✅ Self-service platform accessed via web browser
- ✅ Automated features available immediately upon subscription
- ✅ Technical support (not custom development)

**What Afilo is NOT:**
- ❌ Custom software development services
- ❌ Professional consulting or implementation services
- ❌ Human-driven project management or customization
- ❌ On-premise software installation or configuration

**Demo Sessions Clarification:**
> "We offer free product demos to help you evaluate Afilo before purchase. These are **informational sessions only** and **do not constitute professional services**. All demos are provided at no cost and require no commitment."
