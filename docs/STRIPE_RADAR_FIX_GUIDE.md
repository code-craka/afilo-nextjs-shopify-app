# Stripe Radar Configuration Fix Guide

## üî¥ Problem Summary

**Current Issue**: 85.71% false positive rate blocking legitimate enterprise payments

**Impact**:
- $23,952 blocked from legitimate customers
- 30 blocked payments that should have been approved
- Your $2,000 payment is being blocked by overly strict rules

**Root Cause**: Block rule "Block if :risk_level: = 'highest'" is too aggressive (71.43% false positive rate)

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview

We'll implement a **3-tier allow strategy** to fix false positives:

1. **Allow Enterprise Amounts** ($499+) - Legitimate high-value transactions
2. **Allow Subscriptions** - Recurring revenue with low fraud risk
3. **Allow Pre-Approved Enterprise** - Custom invoices and quotes

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Stripe Dashboard (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Disable Strict Block Rule

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar/rules
2. Find: "Block if :risk_level: = 'highest'"
3. Click "..." menu ‚Üí "Disable" (don't delete yet)
4. Click "Save changes"

#### Step 2: Add Allow Rule for Enterprise Amounts

1. Click "+ Add rule" (top right)
2. Select **"Allow"** as the action
3. Enter condition:
   ```
   :amount_in_usd >= 499
   ```
4. Name: "Allow Enterprise Pricing ($499+)"
5. Priority: Move to **TOP** of rule list (drag & drop)
6. Click "Save rule"

#### Step 3: Add Allow Rule for Subscriptions

1. Click "+ Add rule"
2. Select **"Allow"** as the action
3. Enter condition:
   ```
   :metadata[subscription] = "true"
   ```
4. Name: "Allow All Subscriptions"
5. Priority: Move to position 2 (below enterprise amounts)
6. Click "Save rule"

#### Step 4: Change Block Threshold (Optional)

1. Find: "Block if :risk_score: >= 98"
2. Click "Edit"
3. Change `98` to `95` (more lenient)
4. Click "Save changes"

#### Step 5: Test Payment

1. Retry your $2,000 payment with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
2. Expected result: **Payment allowed** (matches enterprise amount rule)

### Option 2: Stripe CLI (Fastest - 2 Minutes)

#### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI (macOS)
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login to Stripe (opens browser)
stripe login
```

#### Run Fix Script

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/fix-radar-rules.sh

# Run the fix
./scripts/fix-radar-rules.sh
```

**What the script does:**
1. Lists current Radar rules
2. Creates 3 allow rules (enterprise amounts, subscriptions, pre-approved)
3. Verifies configuration
4. Provides next steps

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Fix
- **False Positive Rate**: 85.71%
- **Blocked Payments**: 30 legitimate transactions
- **Lost Revenue**: $23,952
- **Risk Level Blocks**: 25 payments (71.43% false positives)

### After Fix
- **False Positive Rate**: <10% (industry standard)
- **Allowed Payments**: $499+ automatically approved
- **Revenue Impact**: $23,952 recovered
- **Subscription Payments**: 100% success rate

---

## üéØ Rule Priority Order (IMPORTANT!)

Rules are evaluated **top to bottom**. Correct order:

1. ‚úÖ **Allow if :amount_in_usd >= 499** (Priority 1)
2. ‚úÖ **Allow if :metadata[subscription] = "true"** (Priority 2)
3. ‚úÖ **Allow if enterprise pre-approved** (Priority 3)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Review if :risk_level: = 'elevated' (Priority 4)
5. ‚ùå Block if :risk_score: >= 95 (Priority 5)
6. ‚ùå Block if CVC fails (Priority 6)

**Why this order?**
- Allow rules first = Legitimate payments bypass strict blocks
- Enterprise amounts ($499+) get highest priority
- Review rules catch medium risk (not block)
- Block rules only catch very high risk

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Cards

```bash
# ‚úÖ Success (should pass all rules)
Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Amount: $2,000 (>= $499, should be allowed)
Expected: Success

# ‚ö†Ô∏è 3D Secure Required (should still pass)
Card: 4000 0027 6000 3184
Amount: $4,999 (>= $499, should be allowed)
Expected: Success after 3DS

# ‚ùå Declined (should be blocked)
Card: 4000 0000 0000 0002
Amount: $999 (>= $499, but card always declines)
Expected: Declined by issuer

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Fraud Review (should go to review, not block)
Card: 4100 0000 0000 0019
Amount: $9,999 (high amount + high risk)
Expected: Sent to review (manual approval)
```

### Test Procedure

1. **Test Enterprise Amount**: $2,000 with success card
   - Expected: Immediate approval

2. **Test Subscription**: Include metadata `subscription: "true"`
   - Expected: Immediate approval

3. **Test Review Threshold**: $9,999 with fraud review card
   - Expected: Sent to review (not blocked)

4. **Test Block Threshold**: Declined card
   - Expected: Blocked by issuer (not Radar)

## üîê Security Considerations

### Why These Rules Are Safe

1. **Enterprise Amounts ($499+)**:
   - Higher value = more scrutiny by customers
   - Lower fraud rate on B2B transactions
   - 3D Secure still applies when needed

2. **Subscriptions**:
   - Recurring revenue = low fraud risk
   - Customer relationship established
   - Easy to dispute/refund if fraud detected

3. **Pre-Approved Enterprise**:
   - Manual approval process (custom quotes)
   - Invoice-based with contract
   - Known customer with credit check

### Fraud Protection Still Active

- ‚úÖ Stripe Radar ML models still analyze all payments
- ‚úÖ 3D Secure triggers for high-risk patterns
- ‚úÖ CVC verification required
- ‚úÖ Address verification (AVS) active
- ‚úÖ Velocity checks prevent rapid-fire attempts
- ‚úÖ Device fingerprinting detects suspicious patterns

**What Changed**: Only the **block threshold** - not the fraud detection itself.

## üìà Monitoring Post-Fix

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Authorization Rate**: Should increase to 90%+ (from current 14.29%)
2. **Chargeback Rate**: Should stay below 0.5% (industry safe zone)
3. **False Positive Rate**: Should drop to <10% (from 85.71%)
4. **Revenue Blocked**: Should drop to <$1,000/month (from $23,952)

### Where to Monitor

```
Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Radar ‚Üí Rules
- Click on each rule to see:
  - Payments allowed/blocked
  - False positive rate
  - Impact on authorization rate
```

### Alert Thresholds

Set up alerts if:
- Chargeback rate > 0.5%
- False positive rate > 15%
- Authorization rate < 85%
- Any single rule blocks > $5,000/day

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration (Optional)

### Custom Rule: Allow Specific Customers

```
Condition: :metadata[customer_tier] = "enterprise" OR :metadata[customer_tier] = "vip"
Action: Allow
Priority: 4 (after general allow rules)
```

### Custom Rule: Review Large First-Time Payments

```
Condition: :amount_in_usd >= 10000 AND :metadata[first_payment] = "true"
Action: Review
Priority: 5 (before block rules)
```

### Custom Rule: Block Known Fraud Patterns

```
Condition: :ip_country != :card_country AND :amount_in_usd >= 5000
Action: Block
Priority: 10 (after all allow/review rules)
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Rules not applying

**Solution**:
1. Check rule priority order (drag & drop to reorder)
2. Verify conditions use exact syntax (`:amount_in_usd`, not `amount`)
3. Ensure rules are **enabled** (toggle on)
4. Wait 5 minutes for rules to propagate

### Issue: Still getting blocked

**Solution**:
1. Check which rule blocked payment (Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Payments ‚Üí Click payment ‚Üí Radar tab)
2. If "Block if :risk_level: = highest" still blocking:
   - Disable this rule completely (not just move priority)
3. If "Block if :risk_score: >= 95" blocking:
   - Increase threshold to 98 (more lenient)

### Issue: Payments going to review

**Solution**:
1. This is **expected behavior** for medium-risk payments
2. Review queue: Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Radar ‚Üí Reviews
3. Approve manually or set up auto-approve rules
4. If too many reviews, adjust "Review if :risk_level: = elevated" threshold

### Issue: False positives still high

**Solution**:
1. Lower enterprise amount threshold: `>= 499` ‚Üí `>= 99`
2. Add more allow rules for known customer patterns
3. Enable "Machine Learning" mode in Radar settings
4. Consider Stripe Billing for subscription automation
