## E-commerce Design Review Summary
This review assesses the Afilo Next.js e-commerce storefront. The application exhibits an elite, professional aesthetic that successfully targets a premium, enterprise-level market. The UI/UX for browsing products and managing enterprise features is exceptionally well-designed, leveraging a modern tech stack (Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS v4, ShadCN UI) to create a high-value user experience.

However, the project is fundamentally not production-ready due to a critical architectural flaw: **all key e-commerce and enterprise components rely exclusively on hardcoded mock data.** This makes the application static and unmanageable from a business perspective. Additionally, the core e-commerce funnel is incomplete, as there are no product detail pages.

While the visual design and frontend implementation are of a very high standard, the data architecture requires a complete overhaul before the site can be considered viable.

### Critical UX Issues
- **Static Data Architecture**: The most severe issue is the reliance on hardcoded data for all dynamic content. The `PremiumPricingDisplay`, `EnterpriseQuoteBuilder`, and `SubscriptionManager` components use mock objects instead of fetching data from a live backend (like the Shopify API or a CMS). This makes pricing, feature, and subscription management impossible without developer intervention and is a blocker for production.
- **Missing Product Detail Pages**: The e-commerce funnel is broken. Users can browse products in a grid but cannot click through to a dedicated product detail page to see more information, view image galleries, or make an informed purchase decision. This is a fundamental omission in any e-commerce experience.

### Mobile Commerce Issues
- **Untested Responsive Behavior**: While the use of responsive Tailwind CSS utilities appears correct, the mobile experience has not been verified on actual devices. A thorough testing pass on various screen sizes is required to identify any potential layout, touch target, or usability issues.

### Tailwind v4 Implementation
- **No Issues**: The Tailwind CSS v4 implementation is flawless. It correctly uses the new "no config" approach, the `@theme` directive, and CSS variables with the modern `oklch()` color function. The styling architecture is clean, modern, and well-executed.

### ShadCN Component Issues
- **No Issues**: The integration with ShadCN UI is excellent. The components are used effectively, and the theming is consistent with the brand's aesthetic. The issue is not with the components themselves but with the static data they are being fed.

### Accessibility Violations
- **No Reduced Motion Query**: The site uses `framer-motion` for animations but fails to implement a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. This is a critical accessibility failure, as it can cause discomfort for users with vestibular disorders.
- **Potential Contrast Issues**: The hero section on the homepage uses light gray text (`text-gray-300`) on a dark, complex gradient. This text may not meet WCAG AA or AAA contrast ratio standards and should be verified with a contrast checker tool.

### Performance Impact
- **Overuse of Client Components**: Key landing pages, such as the homepage (`app/page.tsx`) and the enterprise page (`app/enterprise/page.tsx`), are designated as Client Components (`'use client'`) in their entirety. This forces the entire page to be rendered on the client, which can negatively impact initial load times (LCP/FCP). These pages should be refactored to be Server Components, with interactive elements wrapped in Client Components.

### Brand & Conversion Optimization
- **Confusing Hero CTA**: The "API Demo" link in the main hero section of the homepage is likely to be confusing for the target audience of enterprise buyers and decision-makers. This CTA is better suited for a developer-focused section of the site rather than being a primary call-to-action.

### Recommendations
1.  **PRIORITY 1 - Refactor Data Architecture**: Immediately replace all hardcoded mock data in `PremiumPricingDisplay`, `EnterpriseQuoteBuilder`, and `SubscriptionManager` with live data fetching from a proper backend (e.g., Shopify Storefront API with metafields for custom data, or a headless CMS). This is the most critical task.
2.  **PRIORITY 2 - Implement Product Detail Pages**: Build out the product detail page experience by creating a dynamic route (e.g., `app/products/[handle]/page.tsx`). This is essential to complete the core e-commerce purchasing funnel.
3.  **PRIORITY 3 - Optimize Rendering Strategy**: Refactor `app/page.tsx` and `app/enterprise/page.tsx` to be Server Components. Isolate interactive sections into their own Client Components to improve site performance and SEO.
4.  **Address Accessibility**: Implement a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query in `app/globals.css` to disable animations for users who require it. Audit and fix all text contrast issues to ensure WCAG compliance.
5.  **Refine Homepage CTAs**: Move the "API Demo" link from the hero section to a more appropriate, developer-centric location to maintain a clear and focused message for the primary enterprise audience.
