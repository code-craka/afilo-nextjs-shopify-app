## üîß 1. Stripe Dashboard Configuration

### Step 1: Enable Payment Methods

1. Log in to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Go to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Payment methods**
3. Enable the following payment methods:
   - ‚úÖ **Cards** (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
   - ‚úÖ **ACH Direct Debit** (US bank accounts)

**Important:** Make sure both are enabled in **both test and live mode**.

---

### Step 2: Configure Stripe Radar

Go to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Radar** ‚Üí **Rules**

#### Rule 1: Adaptive 3DS for High-Risk Transactions

```
Condition: :risk_score: > 75 AND :amount: > 50000
Action: Request 3D Secure
Description: Request 3DS for high-risk transactions over $500
```

**Purpose:** Only trigger 3DS when absolutely necessary (high risk + high value)

#### Rule 2: Manual Review for Medium Risk

```
Condition: :risk_score: >= 60 AND :risk_score: <= 85
Action: Review (instead of Block)
Description: Manual review for medium-risk transactions
```

**Purpose:** Don't auto-block medium-risk transactions; review them instead

#### Rule 3: Block Only Extreme Risk

```
Condition: :risk_score: >= 85
Action: Block
Description: Block only extremely high-risk transactions
```

**Purpose:** Minimize false positives while protecting against obvious fraud

#### Rule 4: Enterprise Transactions (Optional)

```
Condition: :amount: > 999900 AND :risk_score: > 75
Action: Block
Description: Extra scrutiny for high-value enterprise transactions
```

**Purpose:** Protect high-value enterprise sales ($10,000+)

### Step 3: Configure Webhooks

#### 3.1 Add Webhook Endpoint

1. Go to: **Developers** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. **Endpoint URL:** `https://app.afilo.io/api/stripe/webhook`
4. **Description:** Afilo Enterprise Marketplace - Payment Events

#### 3.2 Select Events to Listen

Select the following events:

**Payment Intent Events (CRITICAL):**
- ‚úÖ `payment_intent.succeeded`
- ‚úÖ `payment_intent.processing`
- ‚úÖ `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- ‚úÖ `payment_intent.canceled`

**Fraud Prevention Events:**
- ‚úÖ `review.opened`
- ‚úÖ `review.closed`
- ‚úÖ `radar.early_fraud_warning.created`

**Charge Events (Refunds, Disputes):**
- ‚úÖ `charge.refunded`
- ‚úÖ `charge.dispute.created`
- ‚úÖ `charge.dispute.closed`

#### 3.3 Get Webhook Signing Secret

1. After creating the webhook, click on it
2. Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
3. Add to your `.env.local`:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_secret_here
   ```

---

### Step 4: API Keys Setup

Your API keys are already configured in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Already configured ‚úÖ
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51MvvjqFcrRhjqzak...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_51MvvjqFcrRhjqzak...
```

**Security Checklist:**
- ‚úÖ Secret key is never exposed to client-side code
- ‚úÖ Publishable key is safe for public use
- ‚úÖ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Webhook secret is configured

## üß™ 2. Testing Before Go-Live

### Test Page Available

Visit: **http://localhost:3000/test-stripe-payment**

### Test Cards

#### Success Scenarios

**Normal Card (No 3DS):**
```
Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry: 12/30
CVC: 123

```
**Expected:** Payment succeeds immediately, no 3DS challenge

**3DS Required Card:**
```
Card Number: 4000 0027 6000 3184
Expiry: 12/30
CVC: 123
ZIP: 12345
```
**Expected:** 3DS challenge appears, payment succeeds after authentication

#### Failure Scenarios

**Card Declined:**
```
Card Number: 4000 0000 0000 0002

#### ACH Testing

**Test Bank Account:**
```
Routing Number: 110000000
Account Number: 000123456789

## üìä 4. Payment Flow Diagrams

### Card Payment Flow (Instant)

```
Customer submits card
    ‚Üì
Stripe validates card
    ‚Üì
3DS triggered? (if high risk)
    ‚Üì No ‚Üí Charge processed (2 seconds)
    ‚Üì Yes ‚Üí Customer completes 3DS ‚Üí Charge processed

---

## üîç 5. Monitoring & Debugging

### Webhook Testing

Test webhook locally with Stripe CLI:

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Forward webhooks to local endpoint
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

# Trigger test events
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
stripe trigger payment_intent.processing
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed
```

### Webhook Endpoint Health Check

Visit: `https://app.afilo.io/api/stripe/webhook` (GET request)

Expected response:
```json
{
  "name": "Stripe Webhook Handler",
  "status": "configured",
  "events_handled": [...]
}
```

### Payment Intent API Health Check

Visit: `https://app.afilo.io/api/stripe/create-payment-intent` (GET request)

Expected response:
```json
{
  "name": "Stripe Payment Intent API",
  "version": "2.0",
  "supportedPaymentMethods": ["card", "us_bank_account"]
}
```

### Stripe Dashboard Monitoring

**Real-time monitoring:**

## üìà 6. Risk Management Strategy

### Product Tier Risk Thresholds

| Tier | Amount | Review Threshold | Block Threshold |
|------|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Low | <$2,499 | 60 | 80 |
| Medium | $2,499-$4,999 | 70 | 85 |
| High | $5,000-$9,999 | 75 | 85 |
| Enterprise | $10,000+ | 75 | 75 |

**Strategy:**
- Lower-value products: More lenient (increase conversion)
- Higher-value products: Stricter (prevent fraud)
- Enterprise: Strictest (manual review for high-value sales)

### Adaptive 3DS Strategy

**When 3DS Triggers:**
1. Card issuer requires it (EU cards, SCA compliance)
2. High-risk score (75+) + High amount ($500+)
3. Transaction from high-risk country
4. Customer's card has history of fraud

**When 3DS Does NOT Trigger:**
- Normal US transactions (risk score <75)
- Low-value transactions (<$500)
- Trusted customers with payment history

**Result:**
- 90%+ of US transactions: No 3DS (instant checkout)
- 10% high-risk: 3DS protection
- Best of both worlds: Conversion + Security

## üõ°Ô∏è 7. Security Best Practices

### API Key Protection

- ‚úÖ **DO:** Store secret key in environment variables
- ‚úÖ **DO:** Use publishable key in client-side code
- ‚ùå **DON'T:** Commit API keys to git
- ‚ùå **DON'T:** Expose secret key to client-side

### Webhook Security

- ‚úÖ **DO:** Verify webhook signatures
- ‚úÖ **DO:** Use HTTPS for webhook endpoint
- ‚úÖ **DO:** Log all webhook events
- ‚ùå **DON'T:** Process webhooks without signature verification

### PCI Compliance

Afilo is **PCI compliant** because:
- ‚úÖ Stripe.js handles all card data (never touches your server)
- ‚úÖ Payment Element is PCI-DSS certified
- ‚úÖ No card data stored in your database
- ‚úÖ Stripe handles tokenization
