- ‚úÖ Inventory status

- ‚úÖ Variant changes

### What Does NOT Sync Automatically:

‚ùå **Custom App Data** (not stored in Shopify):

- Bundle configurations
- Usage analytics

These are stored in your **Neon Database** and remain separate from Shopify.

## üí≥ Payment Gateway Setup

### Current Configuration:

Your checkout uses **Shopify's hosted checkout page**, which means:

1. **Payment Gateways Enabled in Shopify Admin**:
   - Go to Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Payments
   - All payment methods you enable there will automatically appear at checkout
   - Supported gateways:
     - **Shopify Payments** (Stripe-powered)
     - **PayPal**
     - **Apple Pay / Google Pay**
     - **Credit/Debit Cards**
     - **Buy Now Pay Later** (Afterpay, Klarna, etc.)

2. **How It Works**:
   ```
   User clicks "Proceed to Checkout"
   ‚Üí Creates Shopify Cart via API
   ‚Üí Gets checkoutUrl from Shopify
   ‚Üí Redirects to: shop-name.myshopify.com/checkout/...
   ‚Üí User completes payment on Shopify
   ‚Üí Order created in Shopify Admin
   ‚Üí Customer receives confirmation email
   ```

### Testing Payments:

1. **Test Mode** (Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Payments):
   - Enable Shopify Payments test mode
   - Use test credit cards:
     - Visa: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
     - Mastercard: `5555 5555 5555 4444`
     - Any future expiry date, any 3-digit CVV

2. **Production**:
   - Disable test mode in Shopify
   - Complete Shopify Payments onboarding
   - Real payments will process automatically

## üîå API Integration Points

### 1. Product Fetching (`lib/shopify.ts`)
```typescript
// Products sync automatically via Storefront API
const products = await getProducts({ first: 50 });
// Any updates in Shopify Admin appear immediately
```

### 2. Cart Creation (`hooks/useDigitalCart.ts`)
```typescript
// Line 334-363: Creates Shopify cart
const checkoutUrl = await createShopifyCheckout(payload);
// Redirects to Shopify's hosted checkout
window.location.href = checkoutUrl;
```

### 3. Order Processing
```typescript
// After payment on Shopify:
// 1. Order created in Shopify Admin automatically
// 2. Webhook can be configured for post-purchase actions
// 3. Customer receives Shopify's order confirmation
```

## üìä What Updates Automatically in Shopify

### When You Change Things in Your App:

| Action | Shopify Update | Method |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| User adds to cart | ‚úÖ Cart created in Shopify | Storefront Cart API |
| User completes checkout | ‚úÖ Order created | Shopify Checkout |
| Product price changed in Shopify | ‚úÖ Updates in app immediately | Storefront API |
| New product added in Shopify | ‚úÖ Appears in app | Storefront API |
| Inventory changed in Shopify | ‚úÖ Reflects in app | Storefront API |

### What Does NOT Auto-Update in Shopify:

- **User Profiles**: Stored in Neon DB, not Shopify
- **Educational Discounts**: Applied at checkout, not stored
- **License Management**: Handled in your app, not Shopify
- **Analytics**: Tracked separately in your dashboard

## üîß Advanced: Webhooks for Two-Way Sync

To make Shopify notify your app when orders are placed:

### 1. Configure Webhooks in Shopify Admin:
```
Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Webhooks
Create webhook:
- Topic: "Order creation"
- Format: JSON
- URL: https://app.afilo.io/api/webhooks/shopify/order-created
```

### 2. Handle Webhook (Example):
```typescript
// app/api/webhooks/shopify/order-created/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const order = await request.json();

  // Extract custom attributes
  const userId = order.note_attributes?.find(
    attr => attr.name === 'clerk_user_id'
  )?.value;

  // Update your database
  await saveOrderToDatabase({
    orderId: order.id,
    userId,
    licenseInfo: order.line_items[0].custom_attributes
  });

  // Send license keys via email
  await sendLicenseKeys(order);

  return Response.json({ success: true });
}
```
