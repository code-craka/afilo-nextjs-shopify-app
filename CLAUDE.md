## Workflow Requirements (CRITICAL)

### Context7 MCP Server Integration

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Always run context7 MCP server before ANY operation:
```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest run @geobio/context7 --key fc1c0930-c457-4042-8088-e052f8dff806
```

**Workflow Rules:**
- Context7 provides updated data and must be run before proceeding
- Never skip this step - it's required for data consistency
- Configuration stored in `.claude/mcp-config.json`
- Saved to memory for future session compliance

### Package Manager Requirements

**REQUIRED**: Always use `pnpm` - NEVER use `npm`
- All commands must use `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`
- Package manager enforced in package.json: `"packageManager": "pnpm@8.15.6"`
- Development server: `pnpm dev --turbopack` (ask user before running)
- Lockfile: pnpm-lock.yaml must be kept in sync with package.json for Vercel deployment

### Development Server Protocol

**NEVER run dev server automatically** - always ask user first:
- Ask permission before running `pnpm dev --turbopack`
- User instruction: Dev server currently running on port 3000
- Use Cloudflare Playwright MCP for UI visualization and testing
- Respect user's development environment preferences
